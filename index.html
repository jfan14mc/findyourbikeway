            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the <strong>Bike Route Enhancer</strong> project! Our mission is to improve bike routes by crowdsourcing 
                feedback from cyclists. Help us make cycling safer and more enjoyable by reporting areas to avoid due to traffic, poor 
                road conditions, lack of bike lanes, or any other hazards.
            </p>

        <section class="how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <ol>
                <li class="list">Explore your local bike routes using our map interface.</li>
                <li class="list">Click on the map to mark areas you'd recommend avoiding.</li>
                <li class="list">Submit your feedback by providing details like the reason for avoidance (e.g., heavy traffic, dangerous intersection).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Your input helps us build better biking experiences by highlighting trouble spots, enabling us to guide cyclists on safer, 
                more efficient routes.

            <h2>Why Crowdsourcing?</h2>
            <p>
                Crowdsourcing allows the cycling community to directly improve route recommendations. While standard map services like Google Maps provide basic bike routes, they don't always account for real-time issues like construction, accidents, or bad road conditions. Your on-the-ground experience can help make biking better for everyone.
