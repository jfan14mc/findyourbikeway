            <h2>Why Get-A-Way Was Created </h2>
            <p>
                Created for HackMIT on September 14-15th 2024 by four students. We have a concern for bike paths in Boston as Google Maps often leads bikers on dangerous paths such as highways, crossing illegal roads, etc.

            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the <strong>Bike Route Enhancer</strong> project! Our mission is to improve bike routes by crowdsourcing 
                feedback from cyclists. Help us make cycling safer and more enjoyable by reporting areas to avoid due to traffic, poor 
                road conditions, lack of bike lanes, or any other hazards.

            <h2>Why Crowdsourcing?</h2>
            <p>
                Crowdsourcing allows the cycling community to directly improve route recommendations. While standard map services like Google Maps provide basic bike routes, they don't always account for real-time issues like construction, accidents, or bad road conditions. Your on-the-ground experience can help make biking better for everyone.
